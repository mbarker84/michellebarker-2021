My name is Michelle Barker and I’m a CSS nerd 👋 I’m currently a Senior Front End Developer at [Ada Mode](https://www.ada-mode.com/), where I work on [Windscope](https://windscope.com/), web-based data visualisation and exploration software for wind farm operators.

I like building fun, creative websites and side projects that are also performant and accessible. I also love playing the drums. My happy place is where creativity and code intersect ☺️

You can also find me writing and speaking about CSS and digital sustainability on the web and around the world 🌍
