My name is Michelle Barker and Iâ€™m Lead Front End Developer at [Atomic Smash](https://atomicsmash.co.uk). I like building fun, creative websites and side projects that are also performant and accessible.

### Writing

I regularly write about front end topics on my popular blog, [CSS { In Real Life }](https://css-irl.info), and occasionally write guest posts for other publications. Previously published articles in [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), [24Ways]() and [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/), among others.
